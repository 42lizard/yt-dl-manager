# yt-dl-manager Implementation Plan

## Overview
A Python daemon that manages media downloads using yt-dlp with a user-friendly CLI interface. URLs are managed through an SQLite3 database, downloaded in the best available quality, and organized by extractor type. It features comprehensive configuration management and a modern subcommand-based CLI.

### CLI Interface
Modern subcommand-based interface:
```bash
# Initialize configuration
python -m yt_dl_manager init [--force]

# Add URLs to download queue
python -m yt_dl_manager add "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"

# Add and immediately download
python -m yt_dl_manager add "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --download
# or
python -m yt_dl_manager add "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" -d

# Run the download daemon
python -m yt_dl_manager daemon

# Launch Terminal User Interface
python -m yt_dl_manager tui [--recent-limit N]
```

### Database Schema
Table: `downloads`
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
- `url` (TEXT, unique)
- `status` (TEXT: pending, downloading, downloaded, failed)
- `timestamp_requested` (DATETIME)
- `timestamp_downloaded` (DATETIME, nullable)
- `final_filename` (TEXT, nullable)
- `extractor` (TEXT, nullable)
- `retries` (INTEGER DEFAULT 0)
